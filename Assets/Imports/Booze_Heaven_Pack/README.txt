This extremely affordable package contains 25 items from classic cocktails to bottles of booze, all made with love and care!

Highly detailed and even perfect for VR.

The models are between 78-795 polygons. The package comes with 1024x1024 and 2048x2048 atlased textures: diffuse (Unity 4), albedo (Unity 5) and normal maps. There are also prefabs for all the items in the different texture resolutions to make life easier for you.

Compatible with built-in & URP (universal render pipeline). Simply import the included BHP_3_0_URP unity asset pack and let it overwrite the built-in assets. Change your project settings accordingly.

The bottles come in two different versions: a highly detailed one and a stripped down version with 50% less polygons.

This package is updated every now and then and it's price will go up, but everyone who already owns the package will of course get all updates for free.
